## 🔨😾 Scratch Ban: The Incident Report

### 🚩 Why I was Banned
* **Gvbvdxx Chat:** Used `innerHTML` instead of `textContent`. Users exploited this via **XSS** to inject scripts.
* **The API Bot & The Mute Cycle:** I created a Node.js bot using the Scratch API that allowed users to post comments anonymously. I ran it on a dedicated alt account. 
* **The "Iframe of Doom":** I knew the bot was a massive risk. I even hardcoded a "banned iframe" into the bot's site so people could read *why* it was banned when the time inevitably came. I shrugged it off, but the Scratch Team didn't.
* **The Trace & Final Strike:** The *bot account* got stuck in a loop of getting muted, serving the time, getting the automated *"Welcome back to Scratch!"* message, and getting muted again. Eventually, the Scratch Team tracked the bot back to my main account. They permanently banned both the bot and my main account.

### 🚪 The Exit Strategy: Why I Didn't Go Anonymous
After the ban, I tried making new, anonymous accounts to keep coding. But because I have years of experience, I knew my projects would get popular again. 
I quickly realized something weird: **if this "fake" persona got famous, I would end up being jealous of *myself*.** I hated living as two different people and lying about who I was. Instead of keeping up the act, I decided to take a clean break and **actually asked the Scratch Team to delete my main account.** ### 💾 The Great Rescue
Before I sent that final deletion request, I ran a **custom Node.js scraping script** I wrote to back up every single shared project.

### 🛡️ Hard-Learned Lessons
1. **Never post unmoderated cloud chats.** It's a ban-magnet.
2. **Authenticity Matters:** Living a double life on burner accounts is exhausting. If you want to build raw/13+ projects, just move to GitHub where you can take real credit for your work.
