## 🔨😾 The "Incident Report" (Why I got banned)

### The Failures:
1. **XSS Vulnerability:** Using `innerHTML` on Gvbvdxx Chat.
2. **Security:** Client-side IP bans were too easy to bypass.
3. **API Abuse:** My anonymous comment bot was used by others to bypass filters.

### 🛡️ Lessons for the Next Gen:
* **Don't post unmoderated chats.**
* **Don't trust the "Honor System"**—people will report you just for fun.
