### 👋 Call me: `Gvbvdxx`
(Or **Jason** if that's easier).  
The name came from me hitting the keyboard during the Scratch sign-up screen as a kid—it just stuck!

---

### 📡 Current Status
- **Age:** 15 🎈
- **Grounded** 😞 (Coding my way back to the light).
- **Current Setup:** School Chromebook 💻 (Shoutout to the school gamers/devs!)
- **Strict parents** 🛡️ (They take the computers, but they can't take the Chromebook!)
- **Banned from Scratch** 🔨😾 (The Scratch Team and I don't exactly get along).

---

### 💻 My Tech Stack
- **JavaScript** (Including Node.js)
- **HTML & CSS** / **XML**
- **Electron JS** ⚛️ (My shortcut for desktop apps because C++ is a headache).

#### 🌐 Networking & Backend
- **Protocols:** `WebSockets` & `HTTP` (I prefer the native `http` module over Express—keep it raw!)
- **P2P:** [`simple-peer WebRTC`](https://github.com/feross/simple-peer)

### 🧠 A bit about me
*Note: These aren't official diagnoses yet, but they are based on what my doctor has discussed with me.*

- **Autism?** (Likely 🧠)
- **ADHD** (Definitely 🤪)

---

### 🎒 School & Grades
**Grade:** 9th  
Currently struggling with the standard subjects, but I’m **acing coding**! Sadly, I don't have a formal CS class right now, so I'm staying sharp on my own.

---

### 🎮 Games I'm into
**Main system:** Nintendo Switch 2  
**Preferred system:** PC & Laptop 💻 (More freedom!!)

- **Sonic Robo Blast 2**
- **Roblox** (User: `catc232` — I spend most of my time in the Studio)
- **Sonic Mania, Generations, & Origins**
- **Literally any other Classic Sonic game 🦔** (If it has a spin-dash, I'm there).

### 🛡️ The "Bosses" (School Filters)
Current obstacles in my way:
* **Cisco Umbrella ☂** (DNS/Internet level)
* **Lightspeed Filter Agent 🛑** (Chromebook extension — HATE this one! 😠)
* **Lightspeed Insight Agent 🕵️** (The one that's always watching...)

### 🚀 Projects I've Built
*Not everything is included!*

#### 💬 Chat Apps
* **[Random Rants +](https://randomrants-plus.onrender.com/)** | The go-to chat site for escaping boredom at school.
* [**Legacy Chats (Gvbvdxx Chat, Macre's, etc.)**](http://github.com/gvbvdxx-chat-safe/) | These played a big role in my Scratch history. **Warning:** These use `innerHTML` for messages—don't paste HTML unless you know exactly what it does! [(Try the Live Safe versions)](https://gvbvdxx-chat-safe.github.io/)

#### 🛠️ Game Design Tools
* [**Gvbvdxx Game Maker 3**](https://ggm3-y1xs.onrender.com/) | A Scratch-like alternative to TurboWarp and my previous Mod2.
* [**Gvbvdxx Mod 2**](https://github.com/gvbmod/) | A TurboWarp modification. (Update pending: Source code is a bit messy right now due to the grounding).

#### 🕹️ Games & Engines
* [**Sonic Robo Blast 2 Web**](https://gvbvdxxalt2.github.io/SRB2web/) | A port of SRB2 2.2.15 running via **Emscripten**. Features LAN support with **no port forwarding**!
* [**🦔 Gvbvdxx Sonic Engine**](https://github.com/gvbvdxx/gvbsonic) | A classic Sonic physics engine made in pure JS. Features 360° movement, wall-running, and **Mod Support** (Addons) similar to SRB2—no digging into source code required.
* [**🎤 FNF vs Gvbvdxx**](https://github.com/gvbvdxx/FNFVsGvbvdxxEngine) | Friday Night Funkin' mod featuring custom covers and friends from the Scratch days. (Untangling the source code currently).

#### 🐱 Scratch History
* [**My Scratch Archive**](./projects/README.md) | A collection of projects from before the ban.

### 🧑‍🏫 How I Taught Myself to Code

It all started with a random YouTube video showcasing Scratch 2.0 projects. When I saw that golden **"Create"** button on the Scratch website, I knew I’d found what I wanted to do: build games.

#### 📜 My Evolution:
* **The Scratch Era:** I spent years building projects, eventually becoming obsessed with Scratch Mods. I always wanted to add my own custom blocks, which laid the foundation for what would eventually become **Gvbvdxx Mod**.
* **The Discovery:** While digging into mods, I stumbled upon **JavaScript**. Around the same time, I noticed a `.hta` file in an old *Bad Piggies* installer. I started messing with the code to see how it launched, and that curiosity spiraled into real-world programming.
* **Present Day:** I moved from tweaking installers to building full-scale web apps and game engines for Chrome and Node.js.

### 🔨😾 The "Incident Report": How I got banned from Scratch

#### 💬 The Gvbvdxx Chat Era (The First Bans)
When I was first learning **Socket.io** and **Glitch.com**, I built "Gvbvdxx Chat." It was a simple relay server: whatever you sent, the server echoed to everyone. Naturally, I shared it on Scratch to get an audience.

**The Technical Failures:**
* **XSS Vulnerability:** I was using `innerHTML` instead of `textContent`. Users quickly figured out they could inject scripts and HTML to break the site or redirect people.
* **Security Flaws:** My "IP Ban" system was entirely client-side. It just told the browser, "Hey, please don't let this guy talk," which was trivial to bypass.
* **Moderation:** I thought I was moderating, but "User123" proved that a manual ban-hammer can't keep up with someone dedicated to breaking the rules.

Because I kept sharing the link after being warned, the Scratch Team eventually handed out a permanent ban.

#### 🤖 The Anonymous Commenter (The Final Ban)
Later, I experimented with the **Scratch API** using Node.js. I built a bot that allowed users to post comments anonymously. 

**The Result:**
Since I wasn't strictly filtering what people sent through the bot, it became a tool for people to bypass Scratch's filters. The bot and my account were banned simultaneously. 

**The Exit Strategy:**
After a few attempts at new accounts, I realized the bridge was burnt. I asked the Scratch Team to delete my main account, but not before I ran a **custom Node.js backup script** I wrote to scrape and save every single shared project across my main and **all my alt accounts**.

---

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **To the Scratch Team:** We really need a way to recover *unshared* projects during a ban. Losing months of local "draft" code is a massive blow to young developers.

> [!TIP]
> **Dev Advice:** Don't just backup your main! If you use alts for testing or side-projects, make sure your scripts handle multiple usernames. If I hadn't automated the "Alt Migration," half of my history would be lost.

### 🛡️ Lessons for the Next Generation

If you’re a Scratch dev pushing the boundaries of what the platform can do, learn from my "Incident Reports." Scratch doesn't care how much effort you put into a site; if it breaks their safety logic, it’s gone.

**My "Hard-Way" Recommendations:**

* **Unmoderated Chat:** **DON'T POST.** Even if you have manual bans, if there’s no pre-approval or heavy filtering, they will see it as a liability.
* **Cloud Chat:** Unless it's a "Safe Word List" (Whitelist) type app, **DON'T POST.** Pure open-text cloud chat is an instant ban magnet.
* **API Experiments:** **DON'T POST.** Any tool that allows posting without approval first is a trap—you can (and will) be framed for what other users say.
* **YouTube Links:** Use extreme caution. If your channel features any of the "Forbidden 4" (unmoderated chats, 13+ links, etc.), **DON'T POST IT.** * **Custom Rulesets:** **DON'T POST.** If your site’s rules are even slightly more relaxed than Scratch’s, they’ll consider it a safety risk.
* **13+ Platform Links:** **DON'T POST.** Discord or anything 13+ is an instant strike. Scratch is strictly for all ages.

---

> [!CAUTION]
> **The Bottom Line:** Don't let your hard work get deleted. If you want to build something "raw" or 13+, host it on GitHub or Render and keep it completely separate from your Scratch profile.
