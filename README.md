### 👋 Call me: `Gvbvdxx`
(Or **Jason** if that's easier).  
The name is just a result of "kid-me" smashing the keyboard, in case you were wondering.

---

### 📡 Current Status
- **Grounded** 😞 (Coding my way back to the light).
- **Strict parents** 🛡️
- **Banned from Scratch** 🔨😾 (The Scratch Team and I don't exactly get along).

---

### 💻 My Tech Stack
- **JavaScript** (Including Node.js)
- **HTML & CSS**
- **XML**
- **Electron JS** ⚛️ (My shortcut for desktop apps because C++ is a headache).
- **Roblox Lua** (I know enough to be dangerous, but barely).

> [!NOTE]
> I lean on [Google Gemini](https://gemini.google.com) to help me troubleshoot or ask questions when I'm confused. 
> If something feels AI-generated, that's the reason.

### 🧠 A bit about me
*Note: These aren't professional diagnoses, just how I see myself!*

- **Autism?** (Likely 🧠)
- **ADHD** (Definitely 🤪)

---

### 🎒 School & Grades
**Grade:** 9th  
Currently struggling with the standard subjects, but I’m **acing coding**! Sadly, I don't have a formal CS class right now, so I'm staying sharp on my own.

---

### 🎮 Games I'm into
**Main system:** Nintendo Switch 2  
**Preferred system:** PC & Laptop 💻 (More freedom!!)

- **Sonic Robo Blast 2**
- **Roblox** (User: `catc232` — I spend most of my time in the Studio)
- **Sonic Mania, Generations, & Origins**
- **Literally any other Classic Sonic game 🦔** (If it has a spin-dash, I'm there).

### 🛡️ The "Bosses" (School Filters)
Current obstacles in my way:
* **Cisco Umbrella** (DNS/Internet level)
* **Lightspeed Filter Agent** (Chromebook extension)
* **Lightspeed Insight Agent 🕵️** (The one that's always watching...)

### 🚀 Projects I've Built
*Not everything is included!*

#### 💬 Chat Apps
* **[Random Rants +](https://randomrants-plus.onrender.com/)** | The go-to chat site for escaping boredom at school.
* [**Random Rants (Legacy)**](https://github.com/Random-Rants-Chat/randomrants) | The original version—kept here for history and ownership.

#### 🛠️ Game Design Tools
* [**Gvbvdxx Game Maker 3**](https://ggm3-y1xs.onrender.com/) | A Scratch-like alternative to TurboWarp.
* **Gvbvdxx Mod 2** | A TurboWarp modification. (Update pending: Source code is a bit of a mess right now due to the grounding situation).

#### 🕹️ Games
* [**Sonic Robo Blast 2 Web**](https://gvbvdxxalt2.github.io/SRB2web/) | A port of SRB2 2.2.15 running via **Emscripten**. Features LAN support with **no port forwarding**! Plays right in the browser.
* [**🎤 FNF vs Gvbvdxx**](https://github.com/gvbvdxx/FNFVsGvbvdxxEngine) | A Friday Night Funkin' mod featuring people I met on Scratch. Includes several custom covers—it's a passion project! (Source code is currently being untangled).
