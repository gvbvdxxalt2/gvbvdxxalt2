### 👋 Call me: `Gvbvdxx`
(Or **Jason** if that's easier).  
The name came from me hitting the keyboard during the Scratch sign-up screen as a kid—it just stuck!

---

### 📡 Current Status
- **Grounded** 😞 (Coding my way back to the light).
- **Current Setup:** School Chromebook 💻 (Shoutout to the school gamers/devs!)
- **Strict parents** 🛡️ (They take the computers, but they can't take the Chromebook!)
- **Banned from Scratch** 🔨😾 (The Scratch Team and I don't exactly get along).

---

### 💻 My Tech Stack
- **JavaScript** (Including Node.js)
- **HTML & CSS**
- **XML**
- **Electron JS** ⚛️ (My shortcut for desktop apps because C++ is a headache).
- **Roblox Lua** (I know enough to be dangerous, but barely).

### 🧠 A bit about me
*Note: These aren't official diagnoses yet, but they are potential based on what my doctor has discussed with me.*

- **Autism?** (Likely 🧠)
- **ADHD** (Definitely 🤪)

---

### 🎒 School & Grades
**Grade:** 9th  
Currently struggling with the standard subjects, but I’m **acing coding**! Sadly, I don't have a formal CS class right now, so I'm staying sharp on my own.

---

### 🎮 Games I'm into
**Main system:** Nintendo Switch 2  
**Preferred system:** PC & Laptop 💻 (More freedom!!)

- **Sonic Robo Blast 2**
- **Roblox** (User: `catc232` — I spend most of my time in the Studio)
- **Sonic Mania, Generations, & Origins**
- **Literally any other Classic Sonic game 🦔** (If it has a spin-dash, I'm there).

---

### 🛡️ The "Bosses" (School Filters)
Current obstacles in my way:
* **Cisco Umbrella** (DNS/Internet level)
* **Lightspeed Filter Agent** (Chromebook extension — HATE this one! 😠)
* **Lightspeed Insight Agent 🕵️** (The one that's always watching...)

---

### 🚀 Projects I've Built
*Not everything is included!*

#### 💬 Chat Apps
* **[Random Rants +](https://randomrants-plus.onrender.com/)** | The go-to chat site for escaping boredom at school.
* [**Legacy Chats (Gvbvdxx Chat, Macre's, etc.)**](http://github.com/gvbvdxx-chat-safe/) | These played a big role in my Scratch history. **Warning:** These use `innerHTML` for messages—don't paste HTML unless you know exactly what it does! [(Try the Live Safe versions)](https://gvbvdxx-chat-safe.github.io/)

#### 🛠️ Game Design Tools
* [**Gvbvdxx Game Maker 3**](https://ggm3-y1xs.onrender.com/) | A Scratch-like alternative to TurboWarp and my previous Mod2.
* [**Gvbvdxx Mod 2**](https://github.com/gvbmod/) | A TurboWarp modification. (Update pending: Source code is a bit messy right now due to the grounding).

#### 🕹️ Games & Engines
* [**Sonic Robo Blast 2 Web**](https://gvbvdxxalt2.github.io/SRB2web/) | A port of SRB2 2.2.15 running via **Emscripten**. Features LAN support with **no port forwarding**!
* [**🦔 Gvbvdxx Sonic Engine**](https://github.com/gvbvdxx/gvbsonic) | A classic Sonic physics engine made in pure JS. Features 360° movement and wall-running—the "pro" version of my old Scratch engine. Also can support mods, similar to the "Addon feature" in SRB2. So you don't have to go digging into the source code of the game to add a simple level and stuff.
* [**🎤 FNF vs Gvbvdxx**](https://github.com/gvbvdxx/FNFVsGvbvdxxEngine) | Friday Night Funkin' mod featuring custom covers and friends from the Scratch days. (Untangling the source code currently).
