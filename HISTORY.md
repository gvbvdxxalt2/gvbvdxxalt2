## 📜 The Gvbvdxx Timeline

* **2021-2022 (The Dad Era):** Received my first desktop. Spent a "Pizza Summer" coding through the loss of my dad.
* **The Dark Era:** Uncle moved in. Devices locked away.
* **The 32-bit Era:** Used my grandma's slow laptop to stay in the game.
* **The Birthday Era (Age 13-14):** New Windows 11 Laptop & Desktop. Moved to Native Haxe.
* **The Now:** Back on the Chromebook while the main rigs are in "lockup."

### 📉 Technical Hurdles & Lost Media
* **The Attic Breach:** Snatched my laptop back to edit the **Editorial V1 FLP**, saved it to MicroSD, then lost the card. **Oof.**
* **The Kill Switch:** My uncle uses the Spectrum app to pause my MAC address. This is why I build **P2P apps**.
* **Thermal Limits:** My $600 laptop runs so hot it burns my fingers. I’m a **Desktop Main** for life now.
