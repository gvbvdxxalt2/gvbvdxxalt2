## 📜 The Gvbvdxx Chronicle

### 🛠️ The Hardware Timeline
1. **The Dad Era (2021-2022):** My first desktop, a gift from my dad. It's where I spent the summer of 2022 coding through grief with pizza and SRB2.
2. **The 32-bit Survival:** When my gear was first locked away, I survived on my grandma's **32-bit laptop**. I even found obscure 32-bit builds of Psych Engine just to keep modding.
3. **The "Plane Fan" Era:** My $600 Windows 11 laptop. It has an AMD chip that runs so hot it burns my fingers during long Haxe sessions. It sounds like a jet taking off just running Chrome and Kosmi.
4. **The Attic Breach:** I recently "liberated" my laptop from the attic to finish the **Editorial V1 FLP**, only to lose the MicroSD during a follow-up grounding.

### 📉 The "Kill Switch" & Networking
My uncle uses the **Spectrum App** to pause my internet access. When he flips the switch, it feels like a total outage. 
* **The Counter-Move:** This inspired my obsession with **P2P/WebRTC**. If I build apps that don't need a central server or a router's permission to talk, the "Kill Switch" loses its power.

### 🧠 The Mental Sandbox
When I'm grounded or away from my PC, I walk in circles in an empty room and "simulate" code logic. 
* **The Reality:** Sometimes the mental build is perfect. Other times, the "simple" logic turns into a billion-line nightmare that makes my Chromebook suffer.
