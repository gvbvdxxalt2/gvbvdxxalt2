## 📜 The Gvbvdxx Chronicle

### 🛠️ The Hardware Timeline
1. **The Dad Era (2021-2022):** My first desktop, a gift from my dad. It's where I spent the summer of 2022 coding through grief with pizza and SRB2.
2. **The 32-bit Survival:** When my gear was first locked away, I survived on my grandma's **32-bit laptop**. I even found obscure 32-bit builds of Psych Engine just to keep modding.
3. **The "Plane Fan" Era:** My $600 Windows 11 laptop. It has an AMD chip that runs so hot it burns my fingers during long Haxe sessions. 
4. **The Attic Breach:** I recently "liberated" my laptop from the attic to finish the **Editorial V1 FLP**, only to lose the MicroSD during a follow-up grounding.

### 📉 The Router Wars & Networking
My uncle uses the **Spectrum App** as a "Kill Switch" to pause my MAC address. 
* **The Port Forwarding Incident:** I once managed to wrestle my way into the router settings to try port forwarding for my SRB2 server. The result? A half-success. The port was technically open—a dedicated server-checking site pinged it as 'online'—but the Master Server flat-out refused to list it. 
* **The Solution:** I got tired of fighting routers and UDP heartbeat packets. This is exactly why I built the **WebRTC/P2P** version of SRB2Web.

### 🧠 The Mental Sandbox
When I'm grounded or away from my PC, I walk in circles in an empty room and "simulate" code logic. 
* **The Reality:** My engines don't just "touch" a floor. They actively probe the ground. Whether I'm using the 12-step "Pixel Probe" trick or a multi-point hitbox layout, I spend my offline time figuring out the exact geometry needed so Sonic's momentum transfers perfectly into a loop.
