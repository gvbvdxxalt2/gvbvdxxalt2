### 🛠 Want more blocks & extensions?
If you want to take these projects (or your own) to the next level with features like **Gamepad Support**, check out **Gvbvdxx Mod 2**. You can find the source and links on the [main profile page](../README.md) under the **🛠️ Game Design Tools** section.

### 📜 Reupload Policy
You are welcome to reupload these projects to [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu), but please respect the following:

* **Credit:** Mention `@gvbvdxx` in the Notes & Credits. 
* **The Intro:** For the Sonic Engine, the "Created with..." intro **must** remain in the project. You are welcome to add your own intro *after* it.
* **Labeling:** If you are reuploading without making changes, you **must** state that the project is a reupload.
* **Links:** If you include a link, please **only link to my YouTube**. (Linking to unmoderated chats will get you banned by the Scratch Team! 🔨😾).
* **Modding:** Feel free to mod these! Just keep the original credit intact.

> [!TIP]
> **Pro-tip for Chromebook users:** If your school blocks Google Drive downloads, try opening these in the [TurboWarp Web Editor](https://turbowarp.org/editor) directly using the "File > Load from your computer" option after downloading.
